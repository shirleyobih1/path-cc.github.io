<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Save the Date for HTCondor Week workshop Sept 20 - 24!</p>


HTCondor workshop will be held from Monday 20 September to Friday 24 September 2021. Mark your agendas!

Due to the current pandemic still largely impacting international travel, the workshop will be held purely virtually. (We warmly thank INFN Torino
in Italy for the proposal to host.)

The workshop will be organised as videoconference and/or Webcast sessions of about three hours per day, most probably somewhere between 15:00 h and
19:00 h Paris time (13:00 h - 17:00 h UTC, 8 am - 12 am CDT).

The workshop will be an excellent occasion for learning from the sources (the developers!) about HTCondor, exchanging with your colleagues about
experiences and plans, and providing your feedback to the experts. The HTCondor Compute Element (CE) will be covered as well. Participation is
open to all organisations (including companies) and persons interested inHTCondor (and by no means restricted to particle physics and/or academia!)
If you know potentially interested persons, don't hesitate to make them aware of this opportunity.

The workshop will cover both using and administering HTCondor; topics will be chosen to best match participants' interests (see below).

Attendance is free of charge, but requires registration (see below).

If you consider attending, we would very much like to know about your project, your experience and your plans. Hence you are warmly encouraged
to propose a short presentation.

Registration and abstract submission will be opened soon; a dedicated update will be sent once available.

If you have any questions, please contact us at <hepix-2021condorworkshop-support@hepix.org>.

We are looking forward to a rich, productive workshop, and we hope to meet many of you at the virtual workshop!
